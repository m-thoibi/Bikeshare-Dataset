The objective of the Bike Share Analysis could be to understand various aspects of bike-sharing usage patterns and user behaviors. Some possible objectives include:

1. Number of rides by rider and month: This analysis helps to understand the seasonal variations in bike-sharing usage and which riders are most active during different months.

2. Number of riders by bike type: This analysis aims to understand the popularity of different bike types among users and helps in making decisions related to fleet management and expansion.

3. Number of riders by weekday and rider type: This analysis helps in identifying the usage patterns of different rider types (e.g., casual riders, subscribers) across different days of the week, which can inform marketing strategies and operational decisions.

4. Number of riders by start hour and rider type: This analysis provides insights into the peak hours of bike-sharing usage for different rider types. Understanding when different types of riders are most active can help in optimizing bike availability and scheduling maintenance tasks.

By conducting these analyses, bike-sharing operators can gain valuable insights into user behavior, preferences, and usage patterns, which can inform strategic decisions related to marketing, operations, and service improvements.
